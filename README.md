### Dataset 

The original dataset are also uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13891018).The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets as in the original [paper 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38347-2) and [paper 2](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012100).


All the implementation was conducted in Google Colab + Google Drive. The repository provided the original notebook for reproduction.
